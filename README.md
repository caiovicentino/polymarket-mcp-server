## 🛡️ Safety & Security

### ⚠️ Important Security Considerations

- **Private Key Protection**: Never share or commit your private key
- **Start Small**: Begin with small amounts ($50-100) to test
- **Understand Markets**: Only trade in markets you understand
- **Monitor Positions**: Check your positions regularly
- **Use Safety Limits**: Configure appropriate limits for your risk tolerance
- **Never Risk More**: Than you can afford to lose

### Default Safety Limits

```env
MAX_ORDER_SIZE_USD=1000              # Maximum $1,000 per order
MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_USD=5000          # Maximum $5,000 total exposure
MAX_POSITION_SIZE_PER_MARKET=2000    # Maximum $2,000 per market
MIN_LIQUIDITY_REQUIRED=10000         # Minimum $10,000 market liquidity
MAX_SPREAD_TOLERANCE=0.05            # Maximum 5% spread
REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION_ABOVE_USD=500   # Confirm orders over $500
```

These can be customized in your `.env` file or Claude Desktop config.
